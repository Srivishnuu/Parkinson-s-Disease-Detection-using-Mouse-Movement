Features 

Three diagnostic tests:
1)Follow Line Test (assesses hand steadiness)
2)Draw Square Test (evaluates fine motor control)
3)Click Targets Test (measures reaction time and accuracy)

Comprehensive analysis:
* Calculates deviation from ideal path
* Measures movement smoothness
* Evaluates reaction times and consistency

Personalized recommendations:
1) Provides food suggestions based on risk level
2) Visualizes test results with clear graphics

Requirements:
* Python 3.x
* tkinter (usually included with Python)
* numpy (pip install numpy)

How to Run
python parkinsons_detection.py

Usage

1.Complete all three tests:

* Follow the line while holding mouse button
* Trace the square outline
* Click moving targets as quickly as possible

2.View your results and risk assessment
